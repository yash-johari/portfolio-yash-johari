# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, crafted entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases my skills and projects, highlighting my journey as a full-stack web developer.

## About the Project

### Custom CSS
All the styling for this website is hand-coded by me, without using any CSS framework.

### Interactive Elements
The website features interactive elements implemented with JavaScript.

### Section Highlights
- **Home**: Introduction and social media links.
- **About**: A brief overview of who I am.
- **Skills**: Technologies and tools I am proficient in.
- **Education**: My academic background.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my projects with links to GitHub.
- **Contact**: A form for getting in touch with me.

## Note

As this project is built entirely by me, you might encounter some bugs or imperfections, especially since no framework was used. The website may not appear perfect on every browser and every device. Also, I have tested this on multiple phones and I encountered that in some of the devices it is not appearing upto the mark, I am constantly trying to fix all the bugs right now. I appreciate your understanding and any feedback you might have.

## Future Plans

I plan to rebuild this portfolio using a modern framework to enhance its performance and cross-browser compatibility.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
